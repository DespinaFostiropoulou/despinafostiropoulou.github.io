  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    With a background in education and applied informatics, I focus on bridging human-centered thinking with 
    technology-driven solutions. As an Educator, I combine pedagogical expertise with structured, analytical 
    approaches to learning and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    I recently completed my MSc in Applied Informatics, strengthening my understanding of data-oriented thinking, 
    digital systems, and technical foundations that support informed decision-making and secure, efficient processes. 
    I am particularly interested in how data analysis techniques can support cybersecurity processes, including risk 
    assessment, anomaly detection, and the protection of sensitive information within digital environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through experience across education, operations, and coordination roles, I have developed a strong ability to 
    organize workflows, support projects, and communicate effectively between technical and non-technical stakeholders. 
    I am driven by continuous learning and motivated to contribute to project-driven teams where clarity, reliability, 
    and measurable impact matter.
